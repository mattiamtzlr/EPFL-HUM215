# Creation of the World in Ancient Egypt
- Important myths:
	- Osirian myth
	- [[#Source The *Book of the Heavenly Cow*|The Book of the Heavenly Cow]]
	  <br>

- Also important: [[03. Myths in Ancient Egypt#The Day-Night Cycle|The day-night cycle]]
	- Creation kind of *repeats itself every day*, as the sun rises every morning when it returns from the land of the dead every morning.
	- This is also mentioned in [[07. Pantheon of Ancient Egypt#Funerary Texts|funerary texts]].
	  <br>

- Once again, there are *multiple traditions* which coexist and influence each other.

## Common Elements to all Cosmogonies
- The *Nouou*
	- described as a liquid substance or an obscure mass
		- older than the sky, the earth, the humans and death itself
	- probably influential to the geography of Egypt
	- rarely directly represented
	  <br>

- The *demiurge*: often the sun, but not exclusively
	- Issued from the Nouou by its own will
	- Autogenic (= self-generating) god
		- Heliopolis / Hermopolis: the sun
		- Memphis: *Ptah*
		- Esna: *Khnoum*
	- rests on a mound

## Cosmogony of Heliopolis
- The *ennead*: the first 9 (original) gods / goddesses according to Heliopolis:

  <br>

- Very important: The sun god, which has multiple forms, *Khepri* in the morning, Ra at lunch and Atoum in the evening:
  ![[forms_of_sun_god.png]]
  From left to right: Khepri, Ra, Atoum
  <br>
  Khepri is represented with the head of a *scarab* as they would create little balls of dung, which they would roll around, which is analogous the Khepri moving the sun, I guess ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
  <br>

- Slides [[11-cosmo_anthro_egypte.pdf#page=35|35 - 48]] go into more detail about the other gods / goddesses in the ennead.
  Most importantly:
	- *Geb*, the earth and *Nut* the sky, often represented together with *Shu*, the air.
		- Geb and Nout are inseparable, Shu interjects by holding Nut above his head while standing next to Geb, keeping him on the floor, thus separating them:

	- The whole Osirian myth thingy once again

## Humans

>  I brought the gods of my sweat into existence. Human beings (*rmṯ*) are the tears (*rmwt*) of my eye


## Source: The *Book of the Heavenly Cow*
- Slides 51 to 63 go into detail about a specific source, called the *Book of the Heavenly Cow*, a text probably originating from the *Amarna* period. See also: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Heavenly_Cow)
  ![[11-cosmo_anthro_egypte.pdf#page=51]]
  <br>

- Mainly talks about:
	- Explanation of the *separation* between men and gods
	- Ra, the first of the gods, who created the other gods and humans
	- Mention of *Nouou*: father of Ra
	- Explanation of the *birth of the sky*, *Nut*, in the form of a *cow*, who raises the sun into the sky
	- Association of the goddess *Hathor* with *Sekhmet*, a dangerous form
	- Role of the messenger god and scribe *Thoth*

# Gods / Goddesses and Animals
- All animals created by the principal god Atoum.
- Many god(desse)s are connected to some animal:
	- Sekhmet => lion
	- Bastet &nbsp;=> cat
	- Hathor &nbsp;=> cow
	- Isis &nbsp; &nbsp;=> cow or bird (falcon)
	- Thoth &nbsp;&nbsp;=> ibis or baboon
	  <br>

- Also very important: the ram *Mendes* and the bull *Apis*
- There were also hybrid entities, gods / goddesses with human heads and animal bodies, the most famous of them being the *Sphinx*.
