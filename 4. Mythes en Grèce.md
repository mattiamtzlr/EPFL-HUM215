# Defining the "Myth"
Some examples of Greek myths:
- Heracles
- Prometheus
- Icarus
- Pandora's Box
- The Odyssey
- ...

## Simple Definition
Ultimately, a myth is a form of speech or a story. Important is *the exact way* the story is told.

### Myth vs *μῦθος* ("Mythos")
The Greek word "μῦθος" (mythos) originally meant nothing more than "word" or "speech".

> [!cite] Homer *Iliad* 18, 252
> ἀλλ᾽ ὃ μὲν ἂρ μύθοισιν (*muthoisin*), ὃ δ᾽ ἔγχεϊ πολλὸν ἐνίκα.
> "But one prevailed with his *words*, and the other with his sword."

> [!cite] Charles Olivier Carbonnel (Historian)
> "nous appelons mythe toute représentation, tout récit, voir même toute idée – avec le nécessaire cortège d’images – largement répandu et diffusé, transmis de génération en génération, qui donne au groupe à la fois sa cohésion culturelle et sa cohérence morale."

> [!cite] Marcel Détienne (Banger quote)
> "Le mythe est un poisson soluble dans les eaux de la mythologie."

Below is a more rigorous definition of the word "myth".

## Complex Definition
![[myths_greek_differences.png]]
- A "myth" (not a "μῦθος" = "mythos"!) is believed to have actually happened, however usually in the distant past. It takes place in a different world and is regarded as sacred. The personifications are usually not human.
<br>

- Ancient Greeks would usually take distance to these stories. However, they were never described as "myths" but as pieces or stories by their respective writers.

### The Function of "myths"
1. The "myth" is a *story* which is told
2. The "myth" is a story which refers to *other stories*.
	- The whole of these stories form a *mythology*.
3. The "myth" *explains* the world; It refers also to rituals.
4. The "myth" is a sign of *unity* and support; It has a strong *identifying* function
5. The "myth" is *not a dogma* (thus not indisputably true); It knows *variants*.
6. The "myth" allows systematic *exploration* of the *imaginary* social limits.

# The "Myth" of Prometheus
- First of all, there is *not just one single* "myth" of Prometheus, thus saying "the myth" of Prometheus is wrong on all levels.
- *Homer* is the big boss of Greek mythology. (the professor said so)
<br>
- The name Prometheus means "think before".

## 1. Epic
There is no mention of Prometheus in the *Homeric poems* (8-th century BCE).

## 2. Fluid
- *Hesiod* mentioned Prometheus in his *Theogony* (8-th to 7-th century BCE), where the following family tree of relations stems from:

	<br>
- This is also where Prometheus was described as fluid because he sympathized with the humans. He is also a bit of a *trickster*.
	- He once tried to trick Zeus (successfully) which is why the whole "steal fire, bring it to the humans, get your liver eaten eternally"-story came into being.

## 3. Creator
- Ancient Greeks didn't really care about how humans were integrated with the rest such as animals and gods.
	- This also means that the thought of humans being created by the gods only came up rarely.
	- One exception: Prometheus and Athena creating the first human (found on a Sarcophagus relief)
	<br>

- There were however mentions of the (supposed) human superiority over animals.

## 4. Philanthropist
- As Prometheus was tied to the pole after having been conducted by Zeus for giving fire to the humans, he starts to ponder and becomes quite philosophic.

<br>

- Everyone has their own story about Prometheus.

## 5. Religious

## 6. Modern
