Pantheon := All the gods of a people or religion *collectively*.
POA = Proche-Orient ancien

# Construction of a Pantheon - Ougarit
- First of all: This isn't judgmental towards either polytheism or monotheism.
<br>
- Multiple forms of writing:
	- Text in *cuneiform* script on clay tablets
		- Very small alphabet, not a lot of vowels.
		  ![[cuneiform_alphabet.png]]
	- *Aramaic* letters in ink on leather or papyrus.

## Ougarit
- Today: *Ras Shamra*, modern day Syria
- City and kingdom
- Period of highest prosperity: 14<sup>th</sup> century BCE (!)
- Commercial centre

There are:
- Palaces
- Multiple temples
- Houses and graves
- Texts

## The Gods and the Mythology
All gods are recognized by their crowns with which they are always depicted.

### El
- Traditional god
- Father of the gods and humans
- Creator of creatures
- Epithet: The bull
- Specialty: Wisdom

### Ba'al
- Traditional "lord"
- Son of El
- Rider of the clouds
- Important source: The cycle of Ba'al
	- The king of the gods on mount Zaphon
	- King of the weather (lightning) / fertility
		- Explains why fertility comes and goes, as Ba'al is often preoccupied with fighting other gods lol
		<br>
	- Fights against Yamm (Sea) and Mot (Death)
		- Whenever he fights Mot in the underworld, it's winter

### Anat
- Daughter of El and sister of Ba'al
- Virgin, young woman which is very strong and agressive
- Goddess of springs but also of war
- Later, also an important goddess in Egypt

### Others
- *Athtarat* / *Astart√©* (companion of El)
- *Yamm* (Sea)
- *Mot* (Death)
- *Dagan* (ancient god, agriculture)
- *Kothar* (smithing)

### List of Gods
- There are multiple official lists
- There isn't one single Ba'al, but a large amount with different attributes. The plural is the *Baalim*
- Some authors count up to 238 different deities

## The Pantheon
- The gods are in relations with each other through families and generations
- They have specific capacities and roles

### Changes
- The events on earth and in the sky are linked
	- The religious festivities on earth reflect the events told in connection to the sky
	- Political interest and the leader's / king's quest for power manifests itself also in the sky.

# Deconstruction of a Pantheon - Ancient Israel
- Ancient Hebrew is hard to translate as the verb "be" can be placed almost everywhere in a sentence
	- This makes it also easy to change the meaning of a sentence, mostly to infer a meaning which was maybe not intended by the original writer.
	- This isn't a grammatical problem however, as it is intended to have multiple meanings. The sentence stays the same, but the meaning differs based on context.
	- Example: (read right to left)

	  The different meanings can be found on [[pantheon_levant.pdf#page=34|slide 34]]

## Kuntillet 'Ajrud
- In modern day Israel
- Lots of *pithos* (large clay container with inscriptions) found, with mythological messages

## Different Theologies
- Monoyahvism: 
  Specific form of monotheism in (ancient) Israel, characterized by the exclusive worship of *Yahweh*, considered to be the unique and supreme God
- Monolatry: There are multiple gods, but we only focus on one
- Monotheism: There is only one single god
<br>
- Combat does not create issues in theology, a god can however punish its own people by *controlling other groups*. By doing stuff like that, any god was actually **the** god acting for his people.
- This also attributes any harm on earth to the same god.
<br>
- There is *Yhwh* which is God in the sky and on earth; There isn't another.
	- Strict monotheism!
- But: The sky isn't empty. In the frame of the familiar religion, it's clear that multiple deities are worshiped. Sources:
	- Theophoric names (onomastics = study of history and origin of proper names)
	- Archaeological finds in homes
	- Traces in texts

# Summary
## Ougarit - a Typical Pantheon
- Clearly described by texts, images and icons and lists of gods and goddesses.
- Each god(dess) has their own sphere of influence, which is related to the world

## Changes
- A pantheon *isn't stable*, there are always changes which reflect particularities of a certain region or other cultures, gods or political changes
- Fight for power of the gods on earth which are evoked by political events on earth.

## Israel - Development of Monotheism
- Yhwh as God of the state
- Differentiation between theological texts / officials and the familiar religion
- Evolution of monotheism through monolatry and monoyahvism
- Multiple beings in the sky (angels, army of the God)
