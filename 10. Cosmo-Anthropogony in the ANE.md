# Cosmogony
- Recall the [[02. Myths in the ANE#Incantation du ver|incantation of the worm]], which provides the following chain of creations:
  ```
  Anou => Sky => Earth => Waters => Canals => Ponds => Worm
  ```
  implying, that the worm was the first creature.
  However, this *wasn't a dogma* back in the day.

## Creation: Fight against Chaos

> [!cite] Hermann Gunkel
> Chaoskampf

- Forces of chaos are for example monsters, which threaten the order of the world. This required strong leaders who kept them in check.
	- These divine monsters were often associated with *water*, as water was thought of as a very strong force.
	- There is always a connection between chaos and elements of *daily life*.

  **Translation**:
  I brought you back to your father's throne and I gave you the weapons with which I fought against the Sea (Têmtum).
  I anointed you with the oil of my triumph and no one has stood before you. 
  Listen to this one word from me: when someone who has a lawsuit appeals to you, saying: ‘I have been wronged’, stand up and judge him; answer him correctly. This is what I want from you. 
  When you go out into the field, do not leave without taking an oracle. When I have given you a favourable oracle, you shall go out into the field. If it is not so, do not go through the gate!
  This is what the respondent [of Addu] said to me.

- Source: *Psalms 74 and 89*, see slides 12 - 13:

  Psalm 74:
  - shows relation between chaos and injustice on earth
  - imminent war
  - reminding the gods of their action to try and motivate them to intervene

  Psalm 89:
  - once again, link between (in-)justice and chaos

## Representations of Chaos
- *Crocodiles*, *Hippos*
	- Both "monsters" of the waters
	- As mentioned above, water was seen as a very destructive force
	- Many stories involved problems caused by them
	- They were often illustrated as being controlled by the gods

## Creation in General
- Very well known and important: *Enuma Elish*
	- Gods didn't have names yet, their destinies weren't fixed yet
	  <br>
	- Creator: *Tiamat* who gave birth to everything
		- She made the clouds from her saliva, the mountains with her head and the *Tiger of Euphrat* from her eyes.
		  With her breasts she created the largest mountains, which had sources providing water.
		  Finally, *Marduk* created the ground, named *Babylone*, meaning "the house of the great gods".
		  <br>
	- By the end, Marduk was exalted by the gods, in gratitude he promised to crate humans from his blood, which will worship the gods.
	  <br>
	- Creation of the sky, the earth and the human, the latter made from divine material.
		- Marduk becomes king of the gods
		- Creation of the *Esangila* temple in Babylone
		- Intersection of creation and culture
		  <br>

- Also very important: The *Hebraic bible* / the *old testament*
	- Creation of the world
		- *'Ex Nihilo'* - from nothing (minecraft reference ?!)
		  <br>
		
		- Classic creation story of the 7 days:
		  First 3 days were about *creation*
		   - Day 1: Creation of light
		   - Day 2: Creation of the sky and the earth
		   - Day 3: Distinction between the earth and the water, plants
		  
		  The next 3 days were about *inhabiting* of these spaces
		   - Day 4: Lights
		   - Day 5: Fish and birds
		   - Day 6: Land animals and humans
		  
		  The last day is reserved for *resting*:
		   - Day 7: *Shabbat*
		     <br>
		   
	- Creation of the human being
		- *Adam* ~ Human, which were made to be after the gods likeness, and which should subdue the fish, the birds, the beasts and every living thing that moves on earth.
		  <br>
		- The human being as the peak of creation, *imago Dei* (image of the gods)
		  <br>
		- In the *garden of Eden*, the human (man) was created, only then the woman was created as well.
			- They eat fruit (not apples, that's a myth) from a tree and become divine like God, thus they have to quit the garden lest they become immortal.
			- From then on they had to live in the outside of the garden, with all its difficulties, but also with sexuality.
