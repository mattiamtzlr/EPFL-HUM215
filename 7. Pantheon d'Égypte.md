# Reminder: Myths in Ancient Egypt
- Term utilised by ancient Greece
- Story which combines the gods and a conclusion explaining one or multiple aspects of the world, often in a fabulous manner.
<br>
- In Ancient Egypt, multiple explications of the same phenomenon were possible even if they seemed contradictory.
	- This stems from varied and multiple sources, allusions, followed texts => **myth-making** (**"mythèmes"**)
	  <br>
- Be careful not to make comparisons to our modern, western thinking.

# Organisation and Hierarchy of the Gods
- There is always a **creating god** which is the first one to be born and who creates the other gods.
- The kings who ruled Ancient Egypt were almost always accompanied by gods, thus the gods have reigned on Earth together with the kings.
<br>
- Deities were linked to a territory which were called **nomes**:

  <br>

- In addition to the creating god, there are two independent hierarchies, called *Meeks*:
	1. Natural hierarchy: by order of creation
	2. Hierarchy following the function of the gods and their forces
- Further, there are *big gods* and *small gods*, the former were known nationally, the latter were regional.
<br>
- Deities are organised in triads: a family composed of three gods
	- Three is the plural in Egypt
- There is always one god, one goddess and one male child god
	- Example: Amon (god), *Mout* (goddess), *Khonsou* (child, god of the moon)
	- Example: Osiris (god), Isis (goddess), Horus (child)
	- Example: Horus (god), *Hathor* (goddess of family, fertility)
		- In the temple of *Dendera*, Hathor is the main goddess
		- In the temple of *Edfou*, Horus is the main god

## Earth's Creation in Ancient Egypt
- There were multiple versions of Earth's creation story, attested in different cities.
- The most notable are:
	- *Heliopolis*, with the sun god *Atoum(-Re)*
	  ![[heliopolis.png]]
	- *Memphis*, with the artisanal god *Ptah*
	- *Hermopolis*, with the *Ogdoad* (the original eight deities)
	- *Esna*, with the pottery god *Khnoum*
- Multiple traditions which coexisted and influenced each other
<br>
- The god *Thot* had the role of taking care of [[3. Mythes en Égypte ancienne#Hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] and scripture. He is not represented in the hierarchy as he is so important that he is kind of hierarchy agnostic.

### The god *Amon*
- "King of the Gods"
- Main deity of *Thebes* which was the capital of Egypt in the 17<sup>th</sup> dynasty.
- Thus, Amon becomes very important.
<br>
- He is also represented in the temples of Karnak, one of if not the largest temples of Egypt.
<br>

# The Osirian Myth

## Funerary Texts:
- Texts in pyramids
	- Sayings and Formulations designed to help the deceased on his journey to the dead
	- Often in green as it represents the ever-regrowing vegetation
	- First attested occurrences: 2410 BCE
	<br>
- Texts in sarcophages / coffins
	- Sayings and Formulations designed to help the deceased on his journey to the dead
	- Formulas painted on the inside walls of elite coffins
	- Mainly used during the middle empire: 2100 - 1800 BCE
	<br>	
- Book of the dead, which was regularly updated in the new year

### Chronology:
![[funerary_texts.png]]

## Osiris
- God of the dead
- No complete biography, only allusions
- In charge of the occidental world (the land of the dead)
<br>

### Plutarch's Osirian Myth
- *Plutarch* (~ 45 - 125 CE) wrote about Isis and Osiris when he visited Egypt towards the end of his life, it is the only known fully-written story about them.
- It is regarded as trustworthy, as Plutarch back then, just as we now, did not know much about Egyptian culture.
<br>
- There are actually two distinct myths to consider:
	1. The archaic conflict between Horus and Seth in the first dynasties:
		- Horus: King of lower Egypt
		- Seth: King of high Egypt
		<br>
	2. The Osirian myth at the end of the fourth / beginning of the fifth dynasty:
		- Osiris and Seth: Sons of *Geb*
		- Osiris: King of all of Egypt
		- Osiris is assassinated by his brother Seth
			- This assassination is never explicitly acknowledged by the Egyptians, it was just assumed or generally known.
			- The body of Osiris was cut up into 14 pieces (according to Plutarch) and spread throughout the country.
			- Then, the pieces were gathered and the body was mummified by Anubis, allowing Osiris to be reborn.
			<br>
		- Conflict between Horus (son of Osiris) and Seth about who obtains the rights to reign.

#### The Conflict between Horus and Seth
- The eye of the falcon (eye of Horus), allows control over the territory:
  ![[eye_of_horus.png]]
  Often worn as a protecting amulet.
<br>
- Horus and Seth were regarded as equal in power. They were even described as "the two companions".
- In the end, Horus becomes the great god and protector of the royalty.
<br>
