# Cosmogony: Creation of the World
- Stories ("myths") of the origins
	- Definitely not a dogma, there are many different variants by renowned authors / poets from the time (e.g. Homer, Hesiod)

## I. Homer
- During a scene where Hera asks Aphrodite about love and desire, the following is stated by Hera:

	> [!cite] Homer
	> I am going to visit the farthest reaches of the fertile earth, Ocean, the origin of the gods, and Tethys our mother, who nurtured me, then brought me up in their own home, receiving me from Rhea on the day when Zeus, the immense voice, put Cronos under the earth and under the fruitless sea. I'm going to visit them, to put an end to their confused quarrels.

	Imlying the following family tree:

	<br>

## II. Hesiod
- More deductive than Homer, talks about why things really are the way they are.
- Muse of the epics: *Calliope*
  <br>

- Relations between the gods:

  ![[relations_gods_hesiod-2.png]]
  <br>

- There was only *chaos* for a long time and then suddenly earth - no one was responsible for the first few moments of the creation.
  <br>

- 1<sup>st</sup> generation:
	- Fight between *Uranus* and and his son *Chronos*, for details see slides 24 - 26:
	  ![[9-cosmo_anthro_grece.pdf#page=24|slides 24 - 26]]
	- Creation of Aphrodite
	- Creation of the night
	  <br>

- 2<sup>nd</sup> generation:
	- Fight between Chronos and Zeus
	- Chronos eats all his children, Zeus revolts and is spared
	- Zeus saves his siblings from Chronos and becomes king of the gods
		- He gives every god(dess) their own distinct function
		  <br>
	- Zeus is very very big brain and births Athena from his head (what)

# Anthropogony
- I am very tired, see [[9-cosmo_anthro_grece.pdf#page=36|slides 36 - 39]] for more lol
  <br> 
  
- Myth of the "races"
- Humans and Gods come from the same place
	- There are two "races", the first (the golden one), those who lived happily and in peace, and the second (the silver one), those who fought each other and protected those who killed others.
	  <br>

- Zeus creates women I guess
- Ancient Greeks were more concerned with *where* they are in the cosmos, and less with *why* they are in the cosmos.
  <br>

- Chain of power:
  ```python
  Gods > Humans (Men > Women) > Animals
  ```
  But:
  - (labour) animals depended on humans, and
  - humans depended on the animals.
    <br>
  - women depended on men (for survival), and
  - men depended on women (for reproduction).
    <br>
  - gods depended on humans for sacrifices.
