## Incantation du ver
- *Anou*: Dieu du ciel et vegetation, père de dieux
- *Ea*: Dieu de l'eau
- *Shamash*: Dieu du soleil
<br>
- The text is about the creation of the world but ultimately the creation of caries or something similar, which has been created by the following chain: `Anou (sky) => earth => water => canals => ponds => worms (caries)`
  The worm is revolting against the gods, because he doesn't want the simple food they want to give him. He wants to live of the gums in people's mouths.
<br>
- As this is however not foreseen by the gods, they decide that humans have the right to protect themselves against the worm. For this a tincture of beer, malt and oil was used.

## L'épopée de Gilgamesh - A la recherche de la vie (éternelle)
- Traditions dés le III-ième millénaire AEC
- Version ninivite du 7-ième siècle (11+1 tablettes)
- Plusieurs versions, réceptions d'autres traditions connues
### *Gilgamesh*
- King of *Uruk* (near Babylon), superhuman (two thirds god)
	- Uruk is real, Gilgamesh might be a myth
- Gilgamesh isn't a very good king 
	- He only wants pleasure as well as all the women
	- Thus, the women have complaints to the gods, mainly
	- *Ishtar*: goddess of Uruk and of love
- The gods create *Enkidu*, his rival, a "primitive savage" who lives in the steppe with a horde of gazelles. The goal is to limit the power of Gilgamesh
- But, Enkidu becomes civilized and an ally / friend of Gilgamesh.
	- To civilize Enkidu, they provide him with sexuality (a prostitute), beer and a barber
	- They became allies / friends after realizing that their powers are on par
	<br>
- Gilgamesh and Enkidu go on a couple of side-quests:
	- He fought against the giant *Humbaba*, the guard of the cedar forest
	- He fought against a celestial bull
- Ultimately Enkidu dies of a fever, induced by the gods, as they decide that Gilgamesh and Enkidu are too strong together.
	- He died without having made a name for himself on the battlefield.
	<br>
- Gilgamesh decides he wants to search for eternal life and wants to meet *Uta-Napishti*. He tells him the story of a great flood where a ship was constructed to save everyone.
	- This was translated by some christian guy which led to controversy
	- Very similar to Noah's arch
	> [!INFO] Note
	> This shows how interconnected the different religions present in the mediterranean are, however generally, the mésopotamian texts are older than their biblical versions.
	- It makes no sense to reason about the name of the person who created the boat.
- Uta-Napishti was a survivor of a purge by a god and was subsequently made immortal by that god to not have to deal with any survivors.
<br>
- Gilgamesh doesn't pass the test of staying awake for 7 days and 7 nights, and thus doesn't receive eternal life.
	- He can only think about death anymore
	- However, he finds a plant which could give him youth, but he puts it aside for a second and it gets eaten by a snake.
	- He accepts that he has to die, but his civilisation and spirits remain.
	- Thus, he makes it his mission to reconstruct all the temples.

### Etiology
An etiology is an investigation of the cause or the reason of something, it takes as a starting point the current state of the world and explains how we arrived there. It is often expressed using mythical elements.  

Concerning Gilgamesh, if not even he can become immortal, no one should even try.

# Conclusion
It is almost impossible to form really district genres of myths, as they are extremely interconnected.
