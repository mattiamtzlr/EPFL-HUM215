# Sources for Egyptology
## Terminology
- **Sources**: *primary documentation*; contemporary sources of the period to be studied.
	- Antiquity sources: ca. 3100 BCE - 500 CE
- **Secondary documentation**: *modern authors* (19<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> century) who write about the Antiquity which are thus recent bibliography and **not sources**.

## Sources
### Religion and History based on Varied Sources
- Written text on different media: hieroglyphs, [[#Alternatives to Hieroglyphs (Hieratic)|Hieratic]], demotic (ordinary language) or Greek.
- Archaeological sites
- Material culture (ceramics, objects of value, etc.)
- Monuments, statues, etc.

All this is supported by:
- Headstones
- Papyrus
- Statues
- Temple and Tomb walls

For examples see slides 9 to 16: ![[slides/3-mythes_egypte_ancienne.pdf#page=9|slides 9 to 16]]

### Hieroglyphs
- Reading direction determined by the direction that the birds in the hieroglyphs face.

### Alternatives to Hieroglyphs (Hieratic)
- Hieratic was a "simpler" written alternative to hieroglyphs, which could easily be written on on other, cheaper media.
- Usually written on *papyrus* or *Ostracon* which were simple pieces of clay-ware or pottery.
	- Papyrus was cheap and abundant at the time.
	- The clay was always "recycled", meaning clay wasn't produced just to write on.
- This was done by scribes, a valuable position.

# The Gods of Ancient Egypt
- Ancient Egypt was smaller than it is today
	- Mainly centered around the Nile river
	- There was a *Lower Egypt* (North) and a *High Egypt* (South):
	  ![[lower_high_egypt.png]]

- Gods are put in the focus of myths in the context of a ritual
	- Gods were often associated to a city, for example *Rê-Horakhty*, the god of the sun who was associated to *Héliopolis*, the city of the sun, in Northern (lower) Egypt.
	- Other examples are:
		- *Amon*, associated to the city *Karnak*
		- *Khonsou*, associated to the city *Karnak* as well
		- *Isis*, associated to the city *Philae*
		- *Horus*, associated to the city *Edfou*

- Knowing the real / natural name of a god meant having power about the thing the god represents. <small> Name of the Wind :) </small>

## The Names of the Gods and their Titles
1. Name: sometimes of known signification
	- Example: the lion-goddess *Sekhmet* = "The Powerful" 
2. Association with two deities: shared function
   Examples
	- *Amon-Rê*, the king of gods (Amon) takes on a solar aspect (Rê)
	- *Rê-Horakhty*, the king of the sun Rê takes on an aspect of the falcon god *Horus* (Hor) which stays in the *Double Horizon* (akhty)
		- The Double Horizon seems to symbolize the two worlds, the overworld and the underworld, the land of [[#Osiris and Death|Osiris]]
1. The name of the god is often followed by a title or other name specifying its function precisely = an epithet.

## Ambivalent Functions of the Gods
- Most of the gods of ancient Egypt had ambivalent functions, in the meaning that they can either bring good or bad things depending on how they are treated.
	- For example, *Sekhmet*, the lion-goddess, which brought sickness, but if treated appropriately with the correct rituals would also heal sickness.
	- Or *Bastet*, the cat-goddess, which stands for protection, maternity, family, love, fertility, etc. but who can also be dangerous.

## The Day-Night Cycle
- As the sun rises in the Orient in the east and sets in the west (Occident), the ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was transported on a barge or raft transported by the god Rê.
- In the west the sun would enter the sub-land of the dead (named *Douat*), the domain of the god of death *Osiris*.
- In the east the sun would be reborn from the land of the dead every morning and continue its journey.

	> Re in his ram-headed form on the *Mesektet* barque, which he used during the night, while traveling through the underworld. 
	> During the day he travels in his falcon-headed form on the *Mandjet* Barque.

## Osiris and Death
- The god Anubis brings the dead to Osiris, where their heart (often a vase) is weighed against a feather.
- Osiris is one of the most important gods, compared to the others, he has the title "grand god". He has many other functions, including:
	- "Master of Abydos" => cultural center of Osiris
	- "in Memphis" => cultural center of Ptah, Osiris

## Amon
- King of the gods
- Main deity of the city of Thebes which was the capital of the XVIII-th dynasty.

# The Variety of Sources and Myths
## Myths
- Term used by ancient Greece.
- Stories to combine the gods and a conclusion which explains one or more aspects of the world, often in a fabulous manner.
- In Egypt there were also multiple explanations for the same phenomenon, sometimes seeming contradictory.
	- This is then referred to as *mythmaking* (*"mythèmes"*)
- Myths should not be compared to our understanding and thinking of today.

## Some Important Myths
- The Osirian myth (only hints) / the fight between Horus and Seth (followed narrative)
- Stories of the birth of the world (hints) / the book of the cow of the skies (followed narrative)

# Myths and Ritual Practices 
- Myths were almost always integrated in a ritual practice
- They served as a technique of *transfer*: a difficult situation for a person (for example sickness) was compared to a situation experienced by the gods.
	- This reference to the gods who overcame the difficulty should increase the odds of it (the overcoming) happening again in a similar situation.
	- This transfer technique is pretty unique to ancient Egypt.
- There are often allusions to one or multiple aspects of a myth, making context difficult to figure out for us.
