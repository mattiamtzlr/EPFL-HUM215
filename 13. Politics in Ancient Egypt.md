# Reminder: Horus vs Seth
- *Ra*, *master of the gods*, in heaven, presides over the council of the gods
  <br>

- *Thoth*: advisor to Ra and the gods
  <br>

- *Osiris*, reigns over the Westerners = the dead
  but Osiris remains linked to vegetation (rebirth of vegetation every year)
  <br>
  
- *Seth*, god of storms, relegated to the desert, but remains the protector of Ra's bark
  <br>
  
- *Isis* and *Nephthys*, the mourners, protectors of the dead + maternal function for Isis
  <br>
  
- Gods organized into families of three (*triads*)
- *Anubis*, in charge of embalming
- *Enthronement of Horus* -> Pharaoh = Horus on earth
