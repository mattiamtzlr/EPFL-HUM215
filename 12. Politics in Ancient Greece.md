# What is a Greek King?
- lots of differences, depending on location

> [!cite] Hesiod, Theogony
> And then they [the Muses] set out for Olympus, proudly making their beautiful voices resound in a divine melody; and around them, at their hymns, the black earth resounded; 
> And a lovely sound rose beneath their feet as they made their way to their father [Zeus], he who reigns in Olympus, holding the thunder and the flaming lightning in his hands, since by his power he triumphed over Kronos, his father, and then to the Immortals, who also distributed all things and fixed their honours.

- The divine *sociomorphism* is very different from the human sociomorphism i.e. Gods were able to change their personality, behavior and similar attributes at will to integrate socially.

## Agamemnon
- Agamemnon is the king of kings, guiding the Achaeans through the Trojan war

> [!cite] Homer, Illiad II
> About Agamemnon:
> He awoke, enveloped by this divine voice.
> Rising from his bed, he put on a fine tunic, very beautiful and brand new, and covered himself with a great cloak.
> On his shiny feet he fastened beautiful sandals and threw his silver-studded sword over his shoulders;
> Then, seizing the unalterable sceptre (σκῆπτρον) of his fathers, He marched towards the nefs of the bronze-clad Achaeans.
> At the hour when the divine Aurora ascended Olympus To announce the day to Zeus as well as to the other gods, The Atrid commanded the heralds with their sonorous voices To call the long-haired Achaeans to assemble (at the ἀγορά). At this call they assembled without delay. First sat in council (βουλή) the old men with big hearts, Near the ship of Nestor, the king (βασιλεύς) born in Pylos.

- To Agamemnon, the rule about divine and human sociomorphism does not apply.

- There isn't really an *empire* in the traditional sense of a pyramidal power structure.

## Other Kings
- Theseus: "ultra-athenic", seen by many as *the* God of Athens.
	- Son of king Aegean, unknown paternal ancestry
	- Mother-in-law Medea is murdered
	- Father commits suicide, so that Theseus can take the royal position
	- There are political reforms (*synoecism-democracy*)
	- Theseus is ostracised (excluded) and dies
	- **EPIC FAIL**
	- But: now a hero

# Conclusion
- Several political systems in Greece (kingships, democracies)
- Royalty &nbsp; => power sharing in spite of everything
- Democracy => fair but not egalitarian
- Democracy => memory of royalty
